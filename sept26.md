# Swift or React Native: Tell us the better option for iOS app development.

It is a dilemma for mobile developers to choose between Swift or React-Native technology for app development. React Native and Swift are relatively new technologies but are currently among the leading platforms for mobile app development. Let’s compare React Native vs Swift and check who the winner is.

## React Native (RN):
RN has been a hot topic in mobile development. It is a JavaScript-based mobile app framework that embraced the tech world by developing cross-platform mobile applications for both iOS and Android.

## Swift:
The Swift programming language is a Python-based, open-source programming language designed by Apple to make it fast and intuitive. This high-tech is used for native iOS iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS development.

Now, each technology has its benefits and drawbacks before deciding on RN or Swift. Let's look at the pros and cons of RN vs Swift. Following are the points:
  
	 
|   | React Native | Swift |
| --- | --- | ---|
| Famous Apps| Walmart, Bloomberg, Facebook| WhatsApp, Linkedin, Slack|
  

Famous Apps	Walmart, Bloomberg, Facebook	WhatsApp, Linkedin, Slack
Sturdiness	Less tough	Tougher
Performance	More Similar Native	Excellent
User-interface	More similar native	Native
Available Developers	Easily approachable	Shortage
Development Cost	Comparatively low	Higher
Coding Speed	Quick for both iOS and Android but somewhat slower for iOS alone.	Very fast for iOS apps
Popularity	Very popular	Average
Cross-Platform	Yes	No
Native Development	No, it uses Libraries and internal APIs.	Yes

The main difference between RN and Swift is the Swift application that runs only on Apple devices, but the RN application which is a cross-platform framework that can run on both iOS and Android.

So, if you want to develop an iOS application, Swift can be the best option as it will give you access to the latest technology and utmost features you can use. However, finding expert developers can be more problematic.

From an overall outlook, it would be more appropriate to use React Native in the following scenarios:
•	JavaScript developers are easily available & affordable whereas Swift professionals are lacking and expensive.
•	Most of the code can be sharable between Android and iOS.
•	The RN app and UI are relatively close to a native application.
•	You want to create Android and iOS apps with a tight budget.
•	Need to create an app that is the same across all platforms.

## Conclusion:

RN and Swift are great platforms to build mobile apps. However, depending on the need of your project and other factors such as application type, project duration, budget, and personal choice, one may be preferable over the other.

Swift is better suited for the following strategies:
•	The App development project is only for the iOS platform.
•	Consider long-term app maintenance.
•	The dynamic, complex app requires a large amount of platform-specific code.


 
Now, RN is better suited in the following cases:
•	To build an app for iOS and Android that involves a small team and a low budget.
•	The application must run in the same look and on different platforms.
